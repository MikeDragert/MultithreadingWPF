# MultiThreading in C#

This project demonstrates multithreading and dependency injection in c#.  The front end is a MVVM application that allows the user to configure up to 10 threads.  Upon hitting execute, the threads will run if/how specefied by the user.  
Dependency inject is used to pass the correct functionality into each thread.  The program will run the threads simultaneously, reporting their resutls to a shared data location.  The results of the shared data are then shown to the user.
